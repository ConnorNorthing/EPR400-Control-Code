# LSRM Control Algorithm

This was used as a learning project to determine the best methods to effectively and efficiently translate a motor carriage using distance sensing, external input signals and rapid firing relays.

## C

The control code was implemented using C and a STM32 microcontroller. The STM32 provided an interface between the software and hardware aspects of this project.
